Group members;

(2) Asad Dadabhoy

Summary
Our group plans to look at the relationship between players in the NBA/MLB and their statistics. We will look into players salary, statistic X, age, advanced stats. The goal is to develop a robust database from multiple sources including: sports-reference API, NBA.com, Data.world. Due to the overlap in our datasets, the best season for evaluation is 2018-2019 season. 

Database: SQL

We will extract the data from the original data sources, transform the datasets with merges and general cleanup and load into a SQL database.

Collections:
Players (playerID as key)
Teams (teamID as key, gameID)
